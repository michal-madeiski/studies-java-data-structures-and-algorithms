# Data Structures and Algorithms - laboratory classes
__stage of studies: 1st year, 2nd semester__

Each lab class dir contains a fully implementation of the given structure.

* Lab1 - basics of java
* Lab2 - iterators
* Lab3 - one-way lists
* Lab4 - two-way linked lists
* Lab5 - simple sorting algorithms (packages "core", "measuring", "testing" were given for use by the lab class instructor)
* Lab6 - efficient sorting algorithms (packages "core", "measuring", "testing" were given for use by the lab class instructor)
* Lab7 - binary heap
* Lab8 - binary search tree
* Lab9 - b-trees

_Lab[number] is a one-week homework assignment.<br>_
_Mod[number] is a live coding task called "modification" by the lab class instructor.<br>_
_Mods for Lab3 to Lab9 can be found in their dirs or directly in the code (marked wuth a comment)._
